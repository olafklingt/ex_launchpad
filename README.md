# ExLaunchpad

An attempt to port my sc_launchpad library to elixir but it is currently not very nice.

## Installation

the package can be installed
by adding `ex_launchpad` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_launchpad, git: "https://github.com/olafklingt/ex_launchpad"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/ex_launchpad](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_launchpad).
